# Mythic
A cross-platform, post-exploit, red teaming framework built with GoLang, docker, docker-compose, and a web browser UI. It's designed to provide a collaborative and user friendly interface for operators, managers, and reporting throughout red teaming. 

## Starting Mythic

Mythic is controlled via the `mythic-cli` binary. To generate the binary, run `sudo make` from the main Mythic directory. 
From there, you can run `sudo ./mythic-cli start` to bring up all default Mythic containers.

More specific setup instructions, configurations, examples, screenshots, and more can be found on the [Mythic Documentation](https://docs.mythic-c2.net) website.

## Installing Agents and C2 Profiles

The Mythic repository itself does not host any Payload Types or any C2 Profiles. Instead, Mythic provides a command, `./mythic-cli install github <url> [branch name] [-f]`, that can be used to install agents into a current Mythic instance.

Payload Types and C2 Profiles can be found on the [overview](https://mythicmeta.github.io/overview) page.

To install an agent, simply run the script and provide an argument of the path to the agent on GitHub:
```bash
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/apfell
```

The same is true for installing C2 Profiles:
```bash
sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http
```

This allows the agents and c2 profiles to be updated at a much more regular pace and separates out the Mythic Core components from the rest of Mythic.

## Updating

Use the `./mythic-cli update` command to check for available updates across `mythic-cli`, `mythic_server`, and `mythic_react`'s UI. 
This will _NOT_ do the update for you, but let you know if an update exists. To check for updates against a specific branch, use `./mythic-cli update -b [branch name]`.


## Mythic Docker Containers
<p align="left">

</p>

Mythic uses Docker and Docker-compose for all of its components, which allows Mythic to provide a wide range of components and features without having requirements exist on the host. However, it can be helpful to have insight into how the containers are configured. All of Mythic's docker containers are hosted on DockerHub under [itsafeaturemythic](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=itsafeaturemythic&type=image).

Additionally, Mythic uses a custom PyPi package (mythic_container) and a custom Golang package (https://github.com/MythicMeta/MythicContainer) to help control and sync information between all the containers as well as providing an easy way to script access to the server.

Dockerfiles for each of these Docker images can be found on [MythicMeta](https://github.com/MythicMeta/Mythic_Docker_Templates).

### mythic-container PyPi
