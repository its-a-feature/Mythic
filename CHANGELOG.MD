## [3.3.2.0] - 2025

### Changed

- Added "selected_os" array option to some eventing triggers to additionally limit not just on payload type but OS as well
  - this is the "os" you select when you build a payload
- 

## [3.3.1-rc94] - 2025-09-05

### Changed

- Fixed a processing bug for staging_translation messages that were getting their messages overwritten

## [3.3.1-rc93] - 2025-08-27

### Changed

- Updated the global setting initializer to properly update from global state

## [3.3.1-rc92] - 2025-08-27

### Changed

- Fixed a bug where consuming containers were never getting their OnStart called

## [3.3.1-rc91] - 2025-08-24

### Changed

- Fixing bug with eventing causing issues with ints

## [3.3.1-rc90] - 2025-08-21

### Changed

- Updated translation container errors to include missing translation container name
- Added new global_setting table
  - You can now add a default user preferences config that gets applied to all new users
- Added new invite_link table
  - invite links are now persistent across reboots
  - removed ability to delete invite links
- Added new `mythic_parsed_params` field to Task entries
  - This shows how mythic parses the parameters from the UI
  - This is viewable from a task, click to "view all parameters"
- Fixed some hasura operations to scope down to current operation only 
- Added new `semver` (semantic version) field to payload types
  - This will be updated in a later version to fetch data from updated pypi/go packages
- Added new TriggerData for the following triggers to allow scoping down to specific commands for specific agents
  - TaskCreate, TaskStart, TaskFinish, TaskIntercept
  - This takes a map[string][]string format (a dictionary of string arrays)
    - The dictionary key is the name of the payload type, the array of strings are the specific commands to trigger on
    - An empty array of strings means this applies for all commands for that payload type
- Added a check in handling messages from agents to check for the all 0 UUID
  - This is now reported back in the UI as a special error to indicate that the connectivity was a success
  - This works in tandem with updated C2 Profiles' sample messages to use all 0 UUID values
- A new keyword is added for responses, `events`, which is an array where you specify the `keyword` (string) and `data` (dictionary) for an eventing workflow you want to trigger
- File Hosting now auto checks and adds `/` if it was somehow missed
- Additional checks were added to make removing files easier in case the file was deleted
- Updated Eventing response intercept logic to cache existing workflows to reduce the overhead of fetching data for every response
- Updated File Hosting tag process to only add tags after C2 Profile returned success for hosting the file
- [UI Updates](/MythicReactUI/CHANGELOG.MD#0368---2025-08-21)

## [3.3.1-rc89] - 2025-08-11

## [3.3.1-rc88] - 2025-07-31

### Changed

- Fixed a bug in cron eventing that would continue even after error

## [3.3.1-rc87] - 2025-07-21

### Changed

- Updated syncing for payload types to only happen with new c2, not all c2
- Updated syncing for translation containers to only force sync payload types when translation container is new

## [3.3.1-rc86] - 2025-07-18

### Changed

- Updated the processing of new file tracking to auto mark the file as completed for uploads

## [3.3.1-rc85] - 2025-07-17

### Changed

- Updated processing of command_augment containers to auto add commands to callbacks on any sync

## [3.3.1-rc84] - 2025-07-07

### Changed

- Updated the processing for completion functions to not blow away subtask error codes

## [3.3.1-rc83] - 2025-07-03

### Changed

- Updated the create credential webhook to more uniquely check for duplicates by type and comment

## [3.3.1-rc82] - 2025-07-02

### Changed

- Updated the cookie value to have secure `false` but httpOnly `true` so that `http` only versions of the UI can still access images via cookies

## [3.3.1-rc81] - 2025-07-01

### Changed

- Updated the invite link code to have fallback mechanisms for determining the full link invite address

## [3.3.1-rc80] - 2025-07-01

### Changed

- Updated back-end to not try to double-add commands when building payloads and checking dependencies

## [3.3.1-rc79] - 2025-06-27

### Changed

- Updated the processing for PushC2 to track the number of connected clients and only mark disconnected when they all exit

## [3.3.1-rc78] - 2025-06-23

### Changed

- Added `payload_id` and `callback_id` as options for tags
- Added `supports_multiple_c2_in_build` and `supports_multiple_c2_instances_in_build` database fields for Payload Types
  - This is prepping for a future update to allow Payload Types to identify if they support multiple c2 to be selected at build

## [3.3.1-rc77] - 2025-06-19

### Changed

- Updated the database to track if a task wants to reprocess with a new command or the original command
  - This was originally updated for `Command Augmentation` containers to allow proper tracking for when
    - the `CommandName` was changed for a new `CommandPayloadType`, but this also resulted in every time the
    - `CommandName` was changed in tasking that the processing would continue under the new command, which isn't always ideal
  - Now, only if you set `response.ReprocessAtNewCommandPayloadType` will the processing change to the new `CommandName`
    - This means that CommandA that sets its `response.CommandName = commandB` and does a `process_response` field will have the message processed at `CommandA` still
    - Setting the above AND `response.ReprocessAtNewCommandPayloadType` will have the `process_response` processed at `commandB` (specify the same payload type name is ok too)
    
## [3.3.1-rc76] - 2025-06-18

### Changed

- Updated processing for agent messages to support new MythicRPCHandleAgentJson function
  - This allows developers to hook into more "standard" agent message processing from MythicRPC locations
- Updated bulk downloading to force host if none exists ("UNKNOWN") and removes trailing "." if no file extension exists
- Fixed an issue where sometimes a callback on checking in after getting hidden wouldn't re-appear in the active table

## [3.3.1-rc75] - 2025-06-11

### Changed

- Updated the processing of completion handlers for tasks to better account script only and child tasks
- Added `cwd` and `impersonation_context` to callbacks as part of their `checkin` and update messages
- Added new `callback` field to agent response dictionary
  - this field allows you to update any fields that you'd normally set in your `checkin` message
- Added new field to tasks, `CommandParameterType`, to better track where processing should go if a task sets a new PayloadType as part of its processing
  - An example would be `forge` updating the command name and container where processing should continue - this new payload type is also tracked
- Updated health check code for database to properly report success

## [3.3.1-rc74] - 2025-06-09

### Changed

- Updated the processing of commands for building payloads to include `dependencies` in a command's attributes
  - if `command1` is a dependency for `command2`, and the user selected command2 but not command1 when building,
    - then mythic will automatically add `command1` to the list of commands that need to be built into the agent
  - an example would be `dependencies = ["command1"]`

## [3.3.1-rc73] - 2025-06-04

### Changed

- Updated the UI to allow creation of new Artifacts (that aren't tied to specific tasks)
- Updated payload updating information to a new GraphQL Action for:
  - description, callback_alert, delete, and callback_allowed
  - New data tracked for callback_allowed to optionally prevent new callbacks from payloads
- Updated Artifact processing
  - Reporting an artifact will result in getting back an `id` for the artifact
  - That `id` can then be sent in future artifact messages to update its `needs_cleanup` and `resolved` status
- Payloads now have a `callback_allowed` attribute
  - this is `true` by default, but setting it to false (toggling in the UI on the payloads page or callback metadata) will prevent future new callbacks from that payload
  - this feature was "implicitly" there when you delete a payload, but that is removed in favor of this new method
  - A new UI element will show on the payload if it's not marked for allowing callbacks

## [3.3.1-rc72] - 2025-6-03

### Changed

- Updated the MythicRPCCallbackUpdate call to allow no specifying C2 Profile when asking to update last checkin time

## [3.3.1-rc71]- 2025-05-30

### Changed

- Updated `help` output to have `help` and `clear` alphabetically included
- Adding regex checks for `help`, so you can do `help list.*` to find all commands that start with `list` that are loaded
- File Uploads (Mythic -> Agent) now track and display chunks sent on the File Search page for Uploads
- State of the vertical navbar (open/close) is saved in user preferences so it'll stay through refresh
- Updated the "InviteLinks" UI button on the settings page to only be enabled if you're an admin and the feature is enabled
- Updated UI and GraphQL to allow bulk file delete
- Added new User Preference to hide browser-based tasking (file browser / process browser) from your normal tasking views
- Updated file media viewer to dynamically update as more chunks for a file are received
- Added a new `task:job_kill` supported UI feature that takes in a raw agent_task_id (uuid)
  - This shows up as a `skull` icon for tasking that has been picked up by the agent but hasn't completed
- Updated UI callback drag columns to match vertical navbar color
  
## [3.3.1-rc70] - 2025-05-22

### Changed

- Updated MythicRPCTaskSearch to allow specifying parent task to get all subtasks
- Fixed bug in TagCreateWebhook
- Added MythicRPCTagCreate
- Added MythicRPCTagSearch
- Added MythicRPCTagTypeGetOrCreate
- Added new trigger - tag_create
- Updated DynamicQueryFunction to take in OtherParameters - the names/values of other paramters in the task
- If a command has `task_response:interactive` in its supported ui features, then Mythic will open up a new interactive component in the UI
  - If that command ALSO has `task:process_interactive_tasks` in their supported ui, then these follow-on tasks will also go to that parent task's create tasking function first
    - If you set this, you can check for this type of task:
      - `taskData.Task.IsInteractiveTask` - boolean True or False
      - `taskData.Task.InteractiveTaskType` - the type of input (normal input, ctrl characters, etc)
        - There's an enum, `InteractiveTask` that can provide insight into what the int TaskTypes mean
      - `taskData.Args.GetCommandLine()` - get what they actually typed
      - `taskData.Args.SetManualArgs("new args\n")` - potentially update the input to something else (don't forget `\n` if you need it!)
  - Otherwise, follow-on tasks in this new interactive component go directly to the agent

  - Updated file download process to cache filemeta information and open file descriptors to minimize disk/database access
  - Updated agent response processing to cache task data for one update instead of per-response
- Updated MythicRPCResponseCreate to also touch the timestamp of the corresponding task to update the UI streaming

## [3.3.1-rc28] - 2024-11-26

### Changed
- Updated the command_augment injection process to use suggested_commands as well as builtin commands
  - one of these two attributes needs to be set to true on the command augment's command for it to be automatically injected into new callbacks
  - this is in conjunction with matching OS requirements and matching the command augment's supported payload types (if specified)
  
## [3.3.1-rc27] - 2024-11-26

### Changed

- Added more functionality to invite links
  - you can now specify a specific operation and role to assign the new operator to

- Updated mythic-cli to properly pass in the environment's mythic_server_allow_invite_links setting

## [3.3.1-rc26]

### Changed

- Updated the automated payload creation process to associate a task_id with the payload
- Execute a container's OnStart method after a file has been removed/edited/created via the UI
- Added new parameter to the create_go_tasking response, ReprocessAtNewCommandPayloadType
  - this allows you to set the response.CommandName to some other command and response.ReprocessAtNewCommandPayloadType to the same or different payload type
  - execution will then pass to that payload type's create_go_tasking for the new `CommandName` .
  - This allows execution chains to happen for processing
- Added two more parameters to the MythicRPCCallbackAddCommand and MythicRPCCallbackRemoveCommand functions
  - AgentCallbackID - allows you to add to callback based on AgentCallbackID (UUID) instead of by TaskID
  - PayloadType - allows you to specify the payload type associated with the commands if they different than the payload type for the callback itself
    - This is helpful for command augment containers that want to register additional augment commands
- Using the UI to add/remove/update files in a container will re-rigger the container's onStart function
  - This allows containers to reprocess data as needed if it changes on disk

## [3.3.1-rc25] - 2024-11-18

### Changed

- Updated how file hosting works for C2 profiles 
  - When syncing to Mythic, C2 profiles get updated file hosting based on existing FileHosted tags in Mythic
  - When stopping file hosting, Mythic ensures that the C2 profile successfully processed the request before updating the corresponding Tag
  
## [3.3.1-rc24] - 2024-11-18

### Changed

- Fixed a bug with onStart messages getting the wrong value for temporary APITokens
- Increased the timeouts for gRPC messages from 1s to 10s

## [3.3.1-rc23] - 2024-11-14

### Changed

- Added a new field to file browser responses, `set_as_user_output` (bool) to indicate that this structured data should be turned into JSON and set as user_output data by Mythic
  - This allows agents to send file browser data once, but get it counted for both the file browser and user_output
- Added endpoints to leverage/set user preferences

## [3.3.1-rc22] -2024-11-6

### Changed

- Payload Search wasn't properly filtering on filename or description
- Added an update to make sure that the payload is not deleted and the build phase was a success too

## [3.3.1-rc21] - 2024-11-5

### Changed

- Fixed an issue where bot accounts were considered as operators for opsec checks

## [3.3.1-rc20] - 2024-11-5

### Changed

- Fixed an issue where some Numbers were getting saved as scientific notation floats
- Temporary update where Wrappers can identify payloads to wrap, not just payloads identifying the wrappers
  - This currently is only additive
  
## [3.3.1-rc19] - 2024-11-1

### Changed

- Updated the file download process to only add to the file browser if data is not a screenshot

## [3.3.1-rc18] - 2024-10-28

### Changed

- Updated the `update_deleted` code for process listings to not filter on callback, but on callback groups
  - this should fix a bug where processes weren't getting marked as deleted even though they should be
  
## [3.3.1.-rc17] - 2024-10-18

### Changed

  - Removed unnecessary C2 Profile restarts when checking configurations and building payloads
  - C2 Profile Functions can now set a field for RestartInternalServer to ask Mythic to restart it for them
- Updated payload build to go on in background instead of blocking build API call
- Updated CommandAugment commands to only autoload builtin and suggested commands to new callbacks

  - Agents need to inspect first packet for new server_id to see if it's \x00\x00 (UDP) or \x05 (TCP)

## [3.3.1-rc15] - 2024-09-27

### Changed

- Updated the proxy stop through the UI to be more precise instead of stopping all proxies based on callback id, port, and port type

## [3.3.0-rc1] - 2024-07-09

### Changed

- Fixed how external_ip is fetched from containers to provide a more accurate representation
- help and clear appear in generic `help` output
- ability to hide callbacks that use the PushOneToMany 
- updated Mythic's cookie to use strict same site and http only flags
- tasking input - fixed issue where double options could be presented when using tab
- tasking input - adjusted so complex types (link info, files, payloads, etc) aren't tab-completable
  - This reduces some confusion when tab completing command parameters
- expand/hide subtasks in UI that have subtasks
- moved plaintext output expand icon to the left of 1 in text editor instead of in the middle
- fixed an issue where sometimes if a tab was open, clicking the keyboard for a callback wouldn't bring that tab back to focus
- fetch server version dynamically in the UI so it updates more often
- update mythic-cli allowed_ips to apply to all web/scripting routes, not just auth
  - this now applies to all routes and sub-routes behind Mythic's local reverse proxy
- cache hasura information and invalidate / re-fetch after any modification to operator operation status 
  - each request went from 3-10ms to 700-1000micro seconds in processing time
- updated list/edit/delete/upload file features for containers to _all_ containers instead of just C2 containers
- fixed bug where non-utf8 characters in keylog data would error on the page
- function to get graphql schema (or option from Mythic)
  - `schema = await mythic.mythic_utilities.fetch_graphql_schema(mythic=mythic_instance)`
  - This is helpful when trying to do GraphQL via Golang
- only admins can create new operators
- only admins can create new operations
- fix the UI when the width is too small causing the top appbar to take up 2 lines and cover buttons
  - now width <1100px will hide some buttons along the top
- after getting logged out, should redirect to where you were via redirect= URL parameter
- updated payloadtype definition to allow specification of UUID length pre-pended to agent messages
  - This can be either 16 or 36 and defaults to 36 (the length of the normal UUIDv4 string)
  - This makes it possible to have 16 Byte UUIDs used for P2P comms 
- updated wrapper builds to not send the wrapped payload bytes via rabbitmq
  - HTTP request to mythic made to fetch bytes from container before passing execution off to build function
  - no change needed by agent developers
- jupyter access token changed from default 'mythic' to randomized 30 char password
  - only affects new installs, but you'll need to fetch this value similar to fetching the hasura secret for GraphQL access
- fixed bug where zipped and downloaded files wouldn't record the final zip size or md5/sha1 hashes
- added button on keylogs page to view all keylogs within a user/host/window combination in your current search window at once
- When sending data back for the file browser, `success` is now an optional boolean field
- C2 Profile debug output is now also sent to the container's debug output so you don't have to view it through the UI

### Added

- Two new fields in agent message for artifacts for `needs_cleanup` and `resolved`
- added `process_short_name` field to Callbacks
  - this is automatically parsed based on the `process_name` returned from agents when they checkin or update their callback information
  - the `process_short_name` is displayed in the Mythic UI callbacks table, but the full `process_name` is shown in the callback detailed metadata view
  - this allows agents to return the full path to the binary when checking in without worrying about it bloating up the UI
- light and dark mode agent icon support
  - If no dark mode icon is provided, the light mode version is used for both by default on new sync
  - There's a new field on payloadtype definitions for a dark mode icon
- MythicRPC call to expose Mythic's way of parsing paths so that agents don't have to do it themselves and it can be standardized
  - MythicRPCFileBrowserParsePath
- added task display_id to tasks shown when doing browser script edits so that it's easier to tell the difference
- added an "email" field on operators
- add new ChooseOneCustom parameter type (build, command, and c2) to allow users to choose from list or add new value
- add new FileMultiple parameter type (build, command, and c2) to allow users to select and upload multiple files at once
- new "Last Updated" time in proxy table so you know when data is flowing
  - the amount of data transfer updates every 20s
- auto-tag files as you download/preview them so that it's easier to see what has been triaged or not by the team
- all consuming containers now are tracked in the UI specifically and have their own name and description fields that must be set
  - This applies to webhooks, loggers, eventing, auth
- A new type of user, a bot account, is now available for creation
  - only admins can create new operator accounts and new bot accounts
  - bot accounts are not available to login
  - a bot account is automatically created for every operation
  - bot accounts can be used to take actions in eventing (as long as the operation lead approves it)
  - admins are able to generate/view/delete apitokens for bot accounts as well
- Added new `logging.UpdateLogToFile` and `logging.UpdateLogToStdout` functions to containers
  - These allow you to dynamically update logging to write to file+stdout or just stdout as needed
  - `mythic_container.logging.update_log_to_file` and `mythic_container.logging.update_log_to_stdout` in Python
- Admins can generate one-time-use invite codes to invite somebody to their Mythic server without pre-creating an account
  - This is disabled by default but can be enabled in .env or in global settings by admins (MYTHIC_SERVER_ALLOW_INVITE_LINKS)
  - Each invite link can be used only once and un-used invite links can be deleted
  - Invite links become invalid when the server restarts
- SSO Support via "auth" containers
  - can redirect to SSO providers (ExampleContainers has example for ADFS) that provide IDP services
  - can process non SSO custom auth as well
  - each case must return an email associated with a user that's logged in
    - Operators now have email addresses optionally associated with them
  - these can be seen via ConsumingServices page
- All containers have an `on_start` function that gets called when the container starts up
  - This function is executed once for every operation that's currently running (not deleted and not complete)
  - This function gets access to a special JWT APIToken that's scoped to the bot account assigned to the operation
    - This JWT is for spectator access (no changes can be made) and only lasts for 5 minutes
    - The goal here is to allow some basic configuration to be performed by the container
- New PayloadType attribute `agent_type` value of `command_augment`
  - CommandAugment containers expose custom tasks to other PayloadTypes and are automatically injected into callbacks
- Payload type definitions have a new `CheckIfCallbacksAliveFunction`
  - This gets a list of active callbacks based on this payload type along with their id, last checkin, first checkin, and sleep_info information
  - This returns back a list of all the callbacks and an indication if they should be marked as "dead" or not
  - "dead" status is reflected by a red skull in the last_checkin column in the callbacks table
  - the `sleep_info` data can be updated at any time as a free-form string via MythicRPC or the UI
  - the `sleep_info` data is also a column you can toggle to view or not in the UI in the callbacks table
  - Added `SendMythicRPCCallbackNextCheckinRange` RPC call to get basic range for next checkin options based on:
    - last_checkin, jitter percentage, and sleep interval
    - This is provided as a helpful way to reduce duplicated efforts in all payload types checking if `time.Now().UTC()` within the possible range
- New Container Type and feature: Eventing
  - Eventing button at the top now added to manage eventing workflows
  - New docs around eventing added

  - Updated with Websocket C2 profile
  - Uses gRPC connections between C2 Docker container and Mythic
- New `TypedArray` parameter type available for commands, build parameters, and c2 profile parameters
  - Useful for generic BoF/COFF style tasking where you need data and a type associated with it
  - Data passed down as an array of tuples: `[ [type, value], [type, value] ]`
  - PayloadType Commands need to supply a TypedArray Parsing Function to handle freeform input for typed array values
    - ex: `my_bof -bof_args int:5 char*:testing wstring:"this is my string"` into proper array of arrays
- New "Host File Through C2" option available for all payloads and files via globe icon
  - Up to the C2 profile to support the RPC call from Mythic and make the file available though

  - `alert` string field is what's displayed to the user in the event log
- Mythic-cli updated to allow options for setting the main UI to listen on IPv4, IPv6, or both
- Agents can now more easily support multiple C2 profiles and have it reflected in the UI
  - Still only one instance of each c2 profile, but that will change in future releases
- Updated callback's "update_info" and "checkin" actions so that callbacks can update their own metadata
- New "Interactive" tasking type available to allow follow-on input in a PTY format
  - Browser view has limitations compared to a full PTY/TTY since it's still in your browser (supports ASNI colors)
    - Non-ANSI color sequence control sequences are ignored in the browser
  - Use the new supported_ui_feature `SupportedUIFeatures:       []string{"task_response:interactive"},` to enable this for your task in the UI
  - With MythicRPC you can open an "interactive" port with your task which you can connect to with a terminal for full PTY support
    - *NOTE* _ALL_ output is still captured and stored in Mythic and viewable in the UI for the task, so be careful about long-running jobs that dump out a lot of data
    - Inputs from the Web UI will appear as "tasks" that you can search. Inputs via the opened port will _not_ appear as tasks.
- Your issued tasks will auto-expand, so it should reduce a click for tasks that finish immediately (help, clear, script_only)
- File Search page updated to have `Bin` and `Strings` views available without needing to expand the dropdown
- Updated `github.com/MythicMeta/MythicContainer` golang package and `mythic_container` PyPi packages
- New database migrations so that you don't have to blow away the database between updates
- Updated user login notification to be debug level (no UI popup)
- Allow dynamic port binding with MythicRPCProxyStart
  - specify a LocalPort of 0 for Socks/Interactive ports and the next lowest available port will be used and returned
- Allow dynamic port closing with MythicRPCProxyStop
  - specify a LocalPort of 0 for Socks/Interactive ports and Mythic will look up the port based on taskID and port type
- Updated ProxyPorts to track "deleted" status so that they're never actually deleted and can be restarted if needed
  - Allows for a better tracking of which callbacks had/have which ports open
